          <p>
          I am a digital product and user experience designer with a strong background in 
          academic and user research. My focus is on creating and refining products to 
          enhance usability by identifying and eliminating pain points that lead to user 
          frustration.
          </p>
          <p>
          With experience in design, project scoping, planning, and programming, I often 
          operate at the intersection of design, development, and project management. This
           allows me to effectively communicate with both project managers and developers,
            ensuring a smoother and more efficient design and development process.
          </p>
          <p>
          Mastering my design tools is essential to me, enabling me to leverage them to 
          their full potential. I stay up to date with industry advancements and 
          incorporate new methodologies into my workflow. I believe in continuous learning
           and exploration, which keeps my work fresh and prevents it from becoming 
           routine. As a lifelong learner, I am always looking to expand my skill set and 
           refine my craft.

                As a Designer at Empact, I played a key role in shaping and enhancing our

                to a more cohesive and consistent user experience across the platform,

                the development of a responsive web application, expanding our product’s 
                accessibility across multiple devices and user groups. Additionally, I 
                established and maintained our Design System, ensuring visual and 
                functional consistency, and introduced user research methodologies into 
                our workflow, embedding a more data-driven approach to design.

                I joined DigitalGuest as an intern to further develop my expertise in UX 
                and UI design. During my time there, I worked extensively with the 
                company’s design system, ensuring consistency across the platform. I was 
                responsible for wireframing and designing new features, modernizing legacy
                 designs to align with current UI standards, and conducting user testing 
                 to validate and refine the user experience. Additionally, I played a role
                 in QA for upcoming features, ensuring design integrity and functionality
                 before release.

                and a user control panel to improve usability and provide a clearer 
                overview for users. Following an iterative process, I conducted user 
                research to gather insights, refine concepts, and ensure the designs 
                effectively addressed user needs. I was responsible for designing new 
                features and modules, maintaining visual consistency, and creating 
                wireframes, low- and high-fidelity prototypes to validate design concepts.
                 Additionally, I contributed to graphic design, documentation, and bug 
                 testing and reporting to enhance product quality and performance.

                I worked with a startup as a UX and UI Designer, contributing to the 
                development of their mobile application for ordering cleaning services. 
                The company aimed to expand its offerings with additional features such as
                 car washing and window cleaning, and my role was to optimize the user 
                 experience and improve the overall app flow. I focused on enhancing 
                 onboarding, implementing quick-fix solutions to refine navigation, and 
                 conceptualizing and designing new features to support the platform’s
